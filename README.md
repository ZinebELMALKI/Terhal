# Background and Problem Statement: 💢
Salma and Zineb are planning to visit 5 Moroccan cities during their 1-week vacation ⏳, but the real challenge is the planning process. They’ve learned that for every week of travel, they need 3 weeks of planing, from finding the best spots to visit to understanding transportation options ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🍃˚.⛰️⋆☁️. Yet, they only speak DARIJA, which makes it hard for them to search in foreign languages. They tried consulting a guide, but it was 5 times more expensive than expected and felt too general. This issue is holding them back 😟, and it’s affecting Morocco’s tourism sector 📉, which contributes 7% of GDP.

Do we really need weeks of prep for just 1 week of travel? And do we need to speak foreign languages to travel in our own country ⁉️

# Impact and Proposed Solution: 💡
Terhal is a chatbot 🤖 powered by LLMs (GPT-4 and Terjman), featuring an easy-to-use interface designed for Moroccan travelers passionate about using DARIJA while searching for the best places to visit in Morocco. It represents a brand-new way to help travelers find the best spots without investing too much time in preparation (time is money 💰). Not only that, it breaks down language barriers by incorporating the casual dialect DARIJA into the search. While built on existing solutions, Terhal combines the trio of cost, quality, and time, offering Moroccan travelers personalized recommendations in under 10 minutes, all in their mother tongue.
