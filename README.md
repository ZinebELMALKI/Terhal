Background and Problem Statement: 💢
Salma and Zineb are planning to visit 5 Moroccan cities during their 1-week vacation ⏳, but the real challenge is the planning process. They’ve learned that for every week of travel, they need 3 weeks of planing, from finding the best spots to visit to understanding transportation options ˚˖𓍢ִ໋🍃˚.⛰️⋆☁️. Yet, they only speak DARIJA, which makes it hard for them to search in foreign languages. They tried consulting a guide, but it was 5 times more expensive than expected and felt too general. This issue is holding them back 😟, and it’s affecting Morocco’s tourism sector 📉, which contributes 7% of GDP.

Do we really need weeks of prep for just 1 week of travel? And do we need to speak foreign languages to travel in our own country ⁉️
